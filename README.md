#Fix My Code Challenge!##
Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge! This is a completely optional project designed to test and improve your coding skills.  Here's what you'll be doing:

Jump into existing codebases: We'll provide you with repositories containing code with errors.
Fix the code!: Your mission is to identify and correct the issues in the code to make it function properly.
Partial knowledge is okay: Sometimes you'll know the programming language used, sometimes you won't. That's part of the challenge!
Benefits:

Sharpen your coding skills: By diagnosing and fixing errors, you'll gain valuable experience in code analysis and problem-solving.
Explore new languages (maybe): If you encounter an unfamiliar language, this is a great opportunity to learn the basics and expand your programming horizons.
Boost your grades (potentially): Successfully completing any part of this project will give you a project grade that can push your overall average above 100%! However, there's no penalty for not participating.
Project Guidelines:

Editors: You're free to use vi, vim, or emacs for making edits.
Compilation Environment: All your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Line Endings: Make sure all your files finish with a new line character.
README Requirement: A README.md file at the project root is mandatory.
Tasks:

The Fix My Code Challenge includes several coding tasks with increasing difficulty levels. Each task involves fixing bugs in provided code repositories.
